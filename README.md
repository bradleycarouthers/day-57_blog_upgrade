Day 57 of 100

Templating with Jinja in Flask Applications, a simple blog. Jinja is a templating language, I was able to use it to embed python code inside of HTML. For statements and if/elif/else would work just fine.

I've never walked in on a capstone project and just flew through it before. Same for this one, really tested my patience haha. So many things had to all work together, including an API and other languages lol. This project was good though because I didn't have to create a separate HTML file for each blog post. Only bits have to be replaced and if there are many more posts, there won't be a problem.
